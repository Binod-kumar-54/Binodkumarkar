            <br>
            <p>Seven billion people are on this Earth, and everybody is different from the rest of others. There is nothing without purpose in this world. Everything has some purpose. Humans are the best creation, and each person is exclusive. Thus, writing about myself, I’m here to express myself that what I see, what I experience and what I plan for my life. I try myself to be modest, passionate, devoted, hardworking and honest. <br> <br>
            
                I’m from a middle-class family of Odisha, I am Binod Kumar. Nobody comes in this world, without the support of family and friends. Actually, whatever you will be, it is just because of your family. My father is a farmer <br>

                My mother is a housewife . They both are happy what they are doing in life . That’s I have learned from my parents the value of time, honesty, hard work and commitment to the purpose. <br> <br>
                
                
                I am a keen reader of novels and spiritual  books as I have a strong interest in spiritual History and avatar of Gods. I also love to read books that refer to the rich history and civilization of ancient India.  At my pre-childhood, I used to listen to stories from my grandmother, and this has a long-lasting effect on me.
                  <br><br>
                
                My Education
                Now i have completed my masters in computer application i had completed BCA from Utkal University 
                my  +2 from kendrapra autonomous college in science and my matriculation (CBSE) from kendrapra public school as i had mentioned it in my home page detailly 
                
                My Strengths
                 i learned many thing from my elder brother in life , that Everything is not easy to achive what you want to achive . keep working on it some are getting it in one chance some are taking time. hardworking , and keep trying is my strength , it comes from when you believe yourself . self-belif is my strength

                The advice of my parents had a keen effect on my habits. I believe to speak the truth and try my best not to lie. My parents always advised me that if I commit a mistake, I should admit it. I try my best to do so. I know how to remain happy in every condition. Because I believe that: “Happiness is not out there; it’s in you.” <br><br>
                
                I am a very adventurous person too and like to take the risk. I like to do a creative thing besides doing old stuff again and again. Learning new things is one thing which I always enjoy. 
                
                Along with this, I fond of reading a few children magazines in which different motivational stories are there. They taught me a high moral lesson. I am a very confident person and know how to talk. I always try to speak to every person according to his requirement so I understand people. <br><br>
                
                My Ambitions in Life
                Everybody has an ambition in life. Aim or ambition is the inner aspiration of man. No man can do anything in the world without aim. So, all of us should be very determined about our aim in life.
                Without good career planning, right from the start, one can’t be on the right track. 
                
                from the starting i have Interest in IT indusrty , computer , how  it is working , for this curiosity i took admission in BCA later in MCA and hopefully i want to get placed as frontend designer in any company , where i can strengthen my skill and potential to company development as well as in my professional career. <br><br>
                
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Conclusion :</span> <br>
                These are all the things which express me. Though nobody can be described in a few sets of sentences. One needs to have yet command of oneself before going to write something about his life. Life is meant to be lived avidly and with visualization to do good for your fellow beings. Keeping this aim in mind, I have always desired to serve my people in whatever capacity I can.
